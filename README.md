## Development

### Develop with docker

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Running

Then simply execute

```bash
pnpm dev
```

to start all packages in development mode.

### Versioning and publishing

When developing a new feature or performing a new bugfix the version of the package(s) must be increased.
In order to process this correctly perform the following steps:

- Run `pnpm changeset` in the root of app in order to create a markdown containing the changes.

- Commit the generated files that are inside `.changeset` folder

- When the changesets files reach the "baseBranch" (actually "main"), a github action will generate a new PR with updated packages versions. Review the PR and approve merge.

- Once the PR is merged into the baseBranch, a github action will publish packages automatically.

## Docker builds

```bash
# Editor webapp
docker build . --target webapp --tag webapp:latest

# Showcase webapp
